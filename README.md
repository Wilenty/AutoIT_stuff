### https://github.com/Wilenty/Universal-AutoIT-Extractor-and-De-obfuscator
Simple as possible tool to extract almost every AutoIT script from compiled programs, even firmly secured. Please check the README.md to prevent any future questions "how to it works", or "why does not work for me".

### https://github.com/Wilenty/Fast-INI-in-memory-for-AutoIT
At program starts first you need to load the ini file into memory, and save the config ini before program closes itself, or when the user close configuration options. Saves the ini file in every change does not brings desired effects, especially on slow HDDs and slow USB storage.
